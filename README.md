![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/094439a8-608a-407b-8731-00ff673f9e9f)

The mod will add a little realism to lighting a fire with a magnifying glass.

## FEATURES
* You can now use the magnifying glass on partly cloudy days (previously you could only do so on clear days).
* The fire must be placed in direct sunlight (the game actually checks whether the position directly in front of the player is in direct, unobstructed sunlight).
