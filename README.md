The mod will add a little realism to lighting a fire with a magnifying glass.

## FEATURES
* You can now use the magnifying glass on **partly cloudy** days (previously you could only do so on **clear** days).
* The fire must be placed in direct sunlight *(the game actually checks whether the position directly in front of the player is in direct, unobstructed sunlight)*.
