![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ed6c457-c069-4113-b88d-b9f2d9f7b819)

The mod will add a little realism to lighting a fire with a magnifying glass.

## FEATURES
* You can now use the magnifying glass on partly cloudy days (previously you could only do so on clear days).
* The fire must be placed in direct sunlight (the game actually checks whether the position directly in front of the player is in direct, unobstructed sunlight).
